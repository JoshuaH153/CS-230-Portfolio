# CS-230-Portfolio

The client, Creative Technology Solutions (CTS), commissioned the development of a web-based game titled Draw It or Lose It. They tasked us with enhancing the current Android app by expanding it to a cross-platform web application while maintaining the game's essence and integrating new features. Throughout the document development process, I excelled particularly in the evaluation section. The structured nature of the code development process proved immensely beneficial, keeping me focused and aligned with project objectives. User needs were paramount in the design phase, ensuring satisfaction for all stakeholders involved. By comprehensively understanding the client's requirements and seamlessly integrating them into my work, I ensured a harmonious outcome. My approach was direct and effective, though I acknowledge the potential for exploring various strategies in future projects.
